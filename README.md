# Console_Finances

## Overview

This activity presents a real-world situation in which JavaScript skills will come in handy. The code is meant to analyze the financial records of a company. The financial dataset has been provided.

## Instructions

Write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When open the code in the browser the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
